# Software Engineering

## Overview

This repository contains the team project developed for the *Software Engineering* course at UBB. The project was created collaboratively by three team members and follows a progressive assignment structure across multiple labs, incorporating core software engineering principles such as modularity, testing, deployment, and team collaboration.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: C# (.NET), ASP.NET Core Web API, Entity Framework
- **Database**: SQL Server
- **Other tools**: Swagger, GitHub Projects, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code

## Structure

The solution is organized into:

- `/client`: Frontend Angular application (includes authentication, user interface for CRUD operations)
- `/server`: ASP.NET Core backend with RESTful API and connection to SQL Server
- `/docs`: PDF assignments detailing each lab task and project requirements

## Assignments Summary

### Assignment 1 - Requirements and Planning
- Created initial requirements and user stories
- Defined project domain and scope
- Proposed system architecture and use-case diagrams

### Assignment 2 - Testing
- Developed unit tests for backend logic
- Implemented automated test coverage and validated expected results
- Used xUnit for testing and mocking where applicable

### Assignment 3 - Desktop App
- Built a functional WPF desktop client that connects to the backend
- Ensured core CRUD operations are functional via the desktop interface

### Assignment 4 - Frontend (Angular)
- Created Angular frontend with routing and form validation
- Connected Angular app to ASP.NET backend API
- Implemented secure user authentication flow

### Assignment 5 - Team Collaboration
- Used GitHub Projects and issues for task tracking
- Participated in code reviews and structured commits
- Documented sprint results

### Assignment 6 - Monitoring and Deployment
- Added logging and monitoring on the backend
- Prepared for deployment using Docker and CI/CD principles

### Assignment 7 - Migration to Web Platform
- Migrated the desktop functionality to ASP.NET Core MVC
- Maintained unified business logic and data access for both desktop and web clients
- Worked in extended teams with other subgroups and participated in large-scale collaboration

## Collaboration

This project was completed in a team of three. Contributions were made jointly to the planning, implementation, testing, and documentation of the system. Additional collaborative assignments (Assignment 7) required integration with other student teams.
